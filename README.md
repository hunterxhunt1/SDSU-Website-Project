# SDSU-Website-Project
This is our Spring 2022 Website project

Team: Cyrus RJ Sagun, Kenneth Amog, Turki Alqahtani

These are the steps to running the website:

1) Must have a MySQL Workbench and have a schema named 'mydb' containing the tables: 'user','registration', and 'cardinfo'.
2) Run the local server through the 'database.py' code.
3) Once connection is established and everything is running, to navigate the website, you must make an account through the sign-up section of the 'login page'.
4) You can navigate throughout the other pages in the navigation bar  on the top of the pages.
